# Outlook

A collection of ideas that need could be implemented.

## Spatial Systems

Based on our implementation in the `metapop`-prototype (github.com/benmaier/metapop), it should be fairly simple to set up more efficient reaction-diffusion systems for `MatrixEpiModel`.

## Fitting to data

- using `lmfit`, we could implement a concise fitting tool to fit models to data
- or pymc3: https://docs.pymc.io/notebooks/ODE_API_introduction.html#Non-linear-Differential-Equations
