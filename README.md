# epipack

Fast prototyping of epidemiological models based on reaction equations. Analyze the ODEs analytically or numerically, or run/animate stochastic simulations on networks/well-mixed systems.

* repository: https://github.com/benmaier/epipack/
* documentation: https://epipack.readthedocs.io/

## Idea

Simple compartmental models of infectious diseases are useful
to investigate effects of certain processes on disease dissemination.
Using pen and paper, quickly adding/removing compartments and transition processes
is easy, yet the analytical and numerical analysis or stochastic simulations
can be tedious to set up and debugâ€”especially when the model changes (even slightly).
`epipack` aims to streamline this process
such that all the analysis steps can be performed in an efficient manner,
simply by defining processes based on reaction equations. `epipack` provides
three base classes to accomodate different problems.

* `EpiModel`: Define a model based on transition, birth, 
  death, fission, fusion, or transmission reactions, integrate the 
  ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of the corresponding well-mixed system
  numerically or simulate it using Gillespie's algorithm.
  Process rates can be numerical functions of time and the system state.
* `SymbolicEpiModel`: Define a model based on transition, birth, 
  death, fission, fusion, or transmission reactions. Obtain the ODEs,
  fixed points, Jacobian, and the Jacobian's eigenvalues at fixed points
  as symbolic expressions. 
  Process rates can be symbolic expressions of time and the system state.
  Set numerical parameter values and integrate the ODEs numerically or
  simulate the stochastic systems using Gillespie's algorithm.
* `StochasticEpiModel`: Define a model based on node transition and
  link transmission reactions. Add conditional link transmission reactions.
  Simulate your model on any (un-/)directed, (un-/)weighted static network,
  or in a well-mixed system.

Additionally, epipack provides a visualization framework to animate
stochastic simulations on networks, lattices,  or well-mixed systems.

## Install

    git clone git@github.com:benmaier/epipack.git
    pip install ./epipack

`epipack` was developed and tested for 

* Python 3.7

So far, the package's functionality was tested on Mac OS X only.

## Dependencies

`epipack` directly depends on the following packages which will be installed by `pip` during the installation process

* `numpy>=1.17`
* `scipy>=1.3`
* `sympy==1.6`
* `pyglet<1.6`

Please note that **fast network simulations are only available if you install** 

* `SamplableSet==2.0` ([SamplableSet](http://github.com/gstonge/SamplableSet))

**manually** (pip won't do it for you).

## Examples

Let's define an SIRS model with infection rate `eta`, recovery rate `rho`, and waning immunity rate `omega` and analyze the system

### Numeric evaluations

In order to numerically integrate the ODEs, use `DeterministicEpiModel`

```python
from epipack import DeterministicEpiModel
S, I, R = list("SIR")
R0 = 2.5
rho = recovery_rate = 1 # let's say 1/days
eta = infection_rate = R0 * recovery_rate
omega = 1/14 # in units of 1/days

SIRS = EpiModel([S,I,R])

SIRS.set_processes([
    #### transmission process ####
    # S + I (eta)-> I + I
    (S, I, eta, I, I),

    #### transition processes ####
    # I (rho)-> R
    # R (omega)-> S
    (I, rho, R),
    (R, omega, S),

])

SIRS.set_initial_conditions({S:1-0.01, I:0.01})

t = np.linspace(0,40,1000) 
result_int = SIRS.integrate(t)
t_sim, result_sim = SIRS.simulate(t[-1])
```

### Stochastic simulations

Let's simulate the system on a random graph (using the parameter definitions above).

```python
from epipack import StochasticEpiModel
import networkx as nx

k0 = 50
eta = R0 * rho / k0
N = int(1e4)
edges = [ (e[0], e[1], 1.0) for e in nx.fast_gnp_random_graph(N,k0/(N-1)).edges() ]

SIRS = StochasticEpiModel([S,I,R],N,edge_weight_tuples=edges)

SIRS.set_link_transmission_processes([
    #### transmission process ####
    # I + S (eta)-> I + I
    (I, S, eta, I, I),
])

SIRS.set_node_transition_processes([
    #### transition processes ####
    # I (rho)-> R
    # R (omega)-> S
    (I, rho, R),
    (R, omega, S),

])

SIRS.set_random_initial_conditions({S:N-int(1e-2*N), I:int(1e-2*N)})
t_s, result_s = SIRS.simulate(40)
```

### Symbolic evaluations

```python
from epipack import SymbolicEpiModel
import sympy as sy

S, I, R, eta, rho, omega = sy.symbols("S I R eta rho omega")

SIRS = SymbolicEpiModel([S,I,R])

SIRS.set_processes([
    #### transmission process ####
    # S + I (eta)-> I + I
    (S, I, eta, I, I),

    #### transition processes ####
    # I (rho)-> R
    # R (omega)-> S
    (I, rho, R),
    (R, omega, S),

])
```

Print the ODE system in a Jupyter notebook

Get the Jacobian

```python
>>> SIRS.jacobian()
```

## Dev notes

Fork this repository, clone it, and install it in dev mode.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:YOURUSERNAME/epipack.git
make
```

If you want to upload to PyPI, first convert the new `README.md` to `README.rst`

```bash
make readme
```

It will give you warnings about bad `.rst`-syntax. Fix those errors in `README.rst`. Then wrap the whole thing 

```bash
make pypi
```

It will probably give you more warnings about `.rst`-syntax. Fix those until the warnings disappear. Then do

```bash
make upload
```
