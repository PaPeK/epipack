Idea
----

Simple compartmental models of infectious diseases are useful to
investigate effects of certain processes on disease dissemination. Using
pen and paper, quickly adding/removing compartments and transition
processes is easy, yet the analytical and numerical analysis or
stochastic simulations can be tedious to set up and debugâ€”especially
when the model changes (even slightly). ``epipack`` aims to streamline
this process such that all the analysis steps can be performed in an
efficient manner, simply by defining processes based on reaction
equations. ``epipack`` provides three base classes to accomodate
different problems.

-  ``EpiModel``: Define a model based on transition, birth, death,
   fission, fusion, or transmission reactions, integrate the ordinary
   differential equations (ODEs) of the corresponding well-mixed system
   numerically or simulate it using Gillespie's algorithm. Process rates
   can be numerical functions of time and the system state.
-  ``SymbolicEpiModel``: Define a model based on transition, birth,
   death, fission, fusion, or transmission reactions. Obtain the ODEs,
   fixed points, Jacobian, and the Jacobian's eigenvalues at fixed
   points as symbolic expressions. Process rates can be symbolic
   expressions of time and the system state. Set numerical parameter
   values and integrate the ODEs numerically or simulate the stochastic
   systems using Gillespie's algorithm.
-  ``StochasticEpiModel``: Define a model based on node transition and
   link transmission reactions. Add conditional link transmission
   reactions. Simulate your model on any (un-/)directed, (un-/)weighted
   static network, or in a well-mixed system.

Additionally, epipack provides a visualization framework to animate
stochastic simulations on networks, lattices, or well-mixed systems.

Check out the `Example <#examples>`__ section for some demos.

Install
-------

.. code:: bash

   git clone git@github.com:benmaier/epipack.git
   pip install ./epipack

``epipack`` was developed and tested for

-  Python 3.7

So far, the package's functionality was tested on Mac OS X only.

Dependencies
------------

``epipack`` directly depends on the following packages which will be
installed by ``pip`` during the installation process

-  ``numpy>=1.17``

Please note that **fast network simulations are only available if you
install**

   (`SamplableSet <http://github.com/gstonge/SamplableSet>`__)

**manually** (pip won't do it for you).

Documentation

Examples
--------

Let's define an SIRS model with infection rate ``eta``, recovery rate
``rho``, and waning immunity rate ``omega`` and analyze the system

Numeric evaluations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to numerically integrate the ODEs, use
``DeterministicEpiModel``

.. code:: python

   from epipack import DeterministicEpiModel
   S, I, R = list("SIR")
   R0 = 2.5
   rho = recovery_rate = 1 # let's say 1/days
   eta = infection_rate = R0 * recovery_rate
   omega = 1/14 # in units of 1/days

   SIRS = EpiModel([S,I,R])

   SIRS.set_processes([
       #### transmission process ####
       # S + I (eta)-> I + I
       (S, I, eta, I, I),

       #### transition processes ####
       # I (rho)-> R
       # R (omega)-> S
       (I, rho, R),
       (R, omega, S),

   ])

   SIRS.set_initial_conditions({S:1-0.01, I:0.01})

   t = np.linspace(0,40,1000) 
   result_int = SIRS.integrate(t)
   t_sim, result_sim = SIRS.simulate(t[-1])

Stochastic simulations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's simulate the system on a random graph (using the parameter
definitions above).

.. code:: python

   from epipack import StochasticEpiModel
   import networkx as nx

   k0 = 50
   eta = R0 * rho / k0
   N = int(1e4)
   edges = [ (e[0], e[1], 1.0) for e in nx.fast_gnp_random_graph(N,k0/(N-1)).edges() ]

   SIRS = StochasticEpiModel([S,I,R],N,edge_weight_tuples=edges)

   SIRS.set_link_transmission_processes([
       #### transmission process ####
       # I + S (eta)-> I + I
       (I, S, eta, I, I),
   ])

   SIRS.set_node_transition_processes([
       #### transition processes ####
       # I (rho)-> R
       # R (omega)-> S
       (I, rho, R),
       (R, omega, S),

   ])

   SIRS.set_random_initial_conditions({S:N-int(1e-2*N), I:int(1e-2*N)})
   t_s, result_s = SIRS.simulate(40)

|stochastic-simulation|

Symbolic evaluations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

   from epipack import SymbolicEpiModel
   import sympy as sy

   S, I, R, eta, rho, omega = sy.symbols("S I R eta rho omega")

   SIRS = SymbolicEpiModel([S,I,R])

   SIRS.set_processes([
       #### transmission process ####
       # S + I (eta)-> I + I
       (S, I, eta, I, I),

       #### transition processes ####
       # I (rho)-> R
       # R (omega)-> S
       (I, rho, R),
       (R, omega, S),

   ])

Dev notes
---------

Fork this repository, clone it, and install it in dev mode.

.. code:: bash

   git clone git@github.com:YOURUSERNAME/epipack.git
   make

If you want to upload to PyPI, first convert the new ``README.md`` to
``README.rst``

.. code:: bash

   make readme

It will give you warnings about bad ``.rst``-syntax. Fix those errors in
``README.rst``. Then wrap the whole thing

.. code:: bash

   make pypi

It will probably give you more warnings about ``.rst``-syntax. Fix those
until the warnings disappear. Then do

.. code:: bash

   make upload
