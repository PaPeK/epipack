epipack
=======

Fast prototyping of epidemiological models based on reaction equations.
Analyze the ODEs analytically or numerically, or run/animate stochastic
simulations on networks/well-mixed systems.

Idea
----

Simple compartmental models of infectious diseases are useful to
investigate effects of certain processes on disease dissemination. Using
pen and paper, quickly adding/removing compartments and transition
processes is easy, yet the analytical and numerical analysis or
stochastic simulations can be tedious to set up and debugâ€”especially
when the model changes (even slightly). ``epipack`` aims to streamline
this process such that all the analysis steps can be performed in an
efficient manner, simply by defining processes based on reaction
equations. ``epipack`` provides three base classes to accomodate
different problems.

-  ``DeterministicEpiModel``: Define a model based on transition, birth,
   death, fission, fusion, or transmission reactions and integrate the
   ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of the corresponding
   well-mixed system numerically.
-  ``SymbolicEpiModel``: Define a model based on transition, birth,
   death, fission, fusion, or transmission reactions. Obtain the ODEs,
   fixed points, Jacobian, and the Jacobian's eigenvalues at fixed
   points as symbolic expressions.
-  ``StochasticEpiModel``: Define a model based on node transition and
   link transmission reactions. Add conditional link transmission
   reactions. Simulate your model on any (un-/)directed, (un-/)weighted
   static network, or in a well-mixed system.

Additionally, epipack provides a visualization framework to animate
stochastic simulations on networks, lattices, or well-mixed systems.

Install
-------

.. code:: bash

   git clone git@github.com:benmaier/epipack.git
   pip install ./epipack

``epipack`` was developed and tested for

-  Python 3.7

So far, the package's functionality was tested on Mac OS X only.

Dependencies
------------

``epipack`` directly depends on the following packages which will be
installed by ``pip`` during the installation process

-  ``numpy>=1.17``
-  ``scipy>=1.3``
-  ``sympy==1.6``
-  ``pyglet<1.6``

Please note that **fast network simulations are only available if you
install**

-  ``SamplableSet==2.0``
   (`SamplableSet <http://github.com/gstonge/SamplableSet>`__)

**manually** (pip won't do it for you).

Examples
--------

Let's define an SIRS model with infection rate ``eta``, recovery rate
``rho``, and waning immunity rate ``omega`` and analyze the system

Numeric evaluations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to numerically integrate the ODEs, use
``DeterministicEpiModel``

.. code:: python

   from epipack import DeterministicEpiModel
   S, I, R = list("SIR")
   R0 = 2.5
   rho = recovery_rate = 1 # let's say 1/days
   eta = infection_rate = R0 * recovery_rate
   omega = 1/14 # in units of 1/days

   SIRS = DeterministicEpiModel([S,I,R])

   SIRS.set_processes([
       #### transmission process ####
       # S + I (eta)-> I + I
       (S, I, eta, I, I),

       #### transition processes ####
       # I (rho)-> R
       # R (omega)-> S
       (I, rho, R),
       (R, omega, S),

   ])

   SIRS.set_initial_conditions({S:1-0.01, I:0.01})

   t = np.linspace(0,40,1000) 
   result = SIRS.integrate(t)

Stochastic simulations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's simulate the system on a random graph (using the parameter
definitions above).

.. code:: python

   from epipack import StochasticEpiModel
   import networkx as nx

   k0 = 50
   eta = R0 * rho / k0
   N = int(1e4)
   edges = [ (e[0], e[1], 1.0) for e in nx.fast_gnp_random_graph(N,k0/(N-1)).edges() ]

   SIRS = StochasticEpiModel([S,I,R],N,edge_weight_tuples=edges)

   SIRS.set_link_transmission_processes([
       #### transmission process ####
       # I + S (eta)-> I + I
       (I, S, eta, I, I),
   ])

   SIRS.set_node_transition_processes([
       #### transition processes ####
       # I (rho)-> R
       # R (omega)-> S
       (I, rho, R),
       (R, omega, S),

   ])

   SIRS.set_random_initial_conditions({S:N-int(1e-2*N), I:int(1e-2*N)})
   t_s, result_s = SIRS.simulate(40)

|stochastic-simulation|

Symbolic evaluations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

   from epipack import SymbolicEpiModel
   import sympy as sy

   S, I, R, eta, rho, omega = sy.symbols("S I R eta rho omega")

   SIRS = SymbolicEpiModel([S,I,R])

   SIRS.set_processes([
       #### transmission process ####
       # S + I (eta)-> I + I
       (S, I, eta, I, I),

       #### transition processes ####
       # I (rho)-> R
       # R (omega)-> S
       (I, rho, R),
       (R, omega, S),

   ])

Dev notes
---------

Fork this repository, clone it, and install it in dev mode.

.. code:: bash

   git clone git@github.com:YOURUSERNAME/epipack.git
   make

If you want to upload to PyPI, first convert the new ``README.md`` to
``README.rst``

.. code:: bash

   make readme

It will give you warnings about bad ``.rst``-syntax. Fix those errors in
``README.rst``. Then wrap the whole thing

.. code:: bash

   make pypi

It will probably give you more warnings about ``.rst``-syntax. Fix those
until the warnings disappear. Then do

.. code:: bash

   make upload
