Gillespie's SSA
---------------

At several points, `epipack` allows to run stochastic simulations
which are all based on Gillespie's stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA).
This algorithm comes with the advantage of working in continuous time,
i.e. with rates instead of probabilities, which preserves neighboring
state correlations in network simulations and therefore correctly samples
trajectories from the original underlying Markov process.

There's a mountain of literature describing how this algorithm works,
so we will be satisfied with a short description of its underlying
principles in the following.

Homogeneous Poisson Processes
=============================

Gillespie's SSA samples events :math:`e` from an event set :math:`E`.
Each event is associated with a constant rate :math:`\lambda_e`.
The total rate of `any` event happening is given as

.. math::

    \Lambda = \sum_{e\in E} \lambda_e.

Now, suppose we're currently at time :math:`t` and we want to know
a time leap :math:`\tau`. Derived from first principles, this time
leap is distributed according to an exponential distribution

.. math::
    
    \tau \sim \mathcal E (\Lambda).

The event that takes place at this time can be chosen from the event
set with probability

.. math::

    \pi_e = \lambda_e / \Lambda.

After the event takes place, the event set and the event rates
can be updated according to the new situation and time is advanced
as 

.. math::

    t \leftarrow t + \tau.

Inhomogeneous Poisson Processes
===============================

When rates are time-dependent the math becomes a little more
tedious but works out as follows.

Each event is associated with a time-varying rate :math:`\lambda_e(t)`.
The total rate of `any` event happening is given as

.. math::

    \Lambda(t) = \sum_{e\in E} \lambda_e(t).

Now, suppose we're currently at time :math:`t` and we want to know
a time leap :math:`\tau`. We find that the quantity

.. math::

    \Theta(\tau) = \int\limits_t^{t+\tau} dt' \sum_{e\in E}\Lambda(t')

is exponentially distributed as :math:`\Theta \sim \mathcal E(1)`.
Hence, we draw a value for :\math:`\tilde\Theta` from the default
exponential distribution and solve the integral :math:`\Theta(\tau)`
for :math:`\tau`.

The event that takes place at this time can be chosen from the event
set with probability

.. math::

    \pi_e(t+\tau) = \lambda_e(t+\tau) / \Lambda(t+\tau).

In `epipack`, two methods exist to solve this integral numerically.
The first method solves the integral :math:`\Theta(\tau)` with
a quadrature method from the scipy.integrate module and applies
a Newton-Raphson root finding method to this numerical integral
function.

The second (and default) method redefines the problem as 
an initial value problem 

.. math::

    \frac{d}{d\tau}\Theta(\tau) = \Lambda(t+\tau), \qquad \Theta(0) = 0

And applies a Runge-Kutta 2(3) method until :math:`\tilde\Theta = \Theta(\tau)`.
This method is faster and has therefore been chosen as the default method.

Both methods yield results that lie within 0.1% of each other.

Temporal Networks
=================

In principle, temporal networks lead to rate functions that change
as step functions. Vestergaard and GÃ©nois have used this to come 
up with a fast
