	abstract = {Since December 2019 the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has produced an outbreak of pulmonary disease which has soon become a global pandemic, known as COronaVIrus Disease-19 (COVID-19). The new coronavirus shares about 82\% of its genome with the one which produced the 2003 outbreak (SARS CoV-1). Both coronaviruses also share the same cellular receptor, which is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) one. In spite of these similarities, the new coronavirus has expanded more widely, more faster and more lethally than the previous one. Many researchers across the disciplines have used diverse modeling tools to analyze the impact of this pandemic at global and local scales. This includes a wide range of approaches {\textendash} deterministic, data-driven, stochastic, agent-based, and their combinations {\textendash} to forecast the progression of the epidemic as well as the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions to stop or mitigate its impact on the world population. The physical complexities of modern society need to be captured by these models. This includes the many ways of social contacts {\textendash} (multiplex) social contact networks, (multilayers) transport systems, metapopulations, etc. {\textendash} that may act as a framework for the virus propagation. But modeling not only plays a fundamental role in analyzing and forecasting epidemiological variables, but it also plays an important role in helping to find cures for the disease and in preventing contagion by means of new vaccines. The necessity for answering swiftly and effectively the questions: could existing drugs work against SARS CoV-2? and can new vaccines be developed in time? demands the use of physical modeling of proteins, protein-inhibitors interactions, virtual screening of drugs against virus targets, predicting immunogenicity of small peptides, modeling vaccinomics and vaccine design, to mention just a few. Here, we review these three main areas of modeling research against SARS CoV-2 and COVID-19: (1) epidemiology; (2) drug repurposing; and (3) vaccine design. Therefore, we compile the most relevant existing literature about modeling strategies against the virus to help modelers to navigate this fast-growing literature. We also keep an eye on future outbreaks, where the modelers can find the most relevant strategies used in an emergency situation as the current one to help in fighting future pandemics.},

	abstract = {Human systems have been modeled and analyzed on the basis of complex networks theory in recent time. This abstraction allows for thorough quantitative analyses to investigate which structural and temporal features of a system influence the evolution of spreading processes, such as the passage of information or of infectious diseases. The first part of this work investigates how the ubiquitous modular hierarchical structure of static real-world networks allows for fast delivery of messages. New heuristics are developed to evaluate random walk mean first passage times and cover times on locally clustered networks. A comparison to average medium approximations shows that the emergence of these minima are pure network phenomena. It is further found that not all modular hierarchical network models provide optimal message delivery structure. In the second part, temporally varying face-to-face contact networks are investigated for their susceptibility to infection. Several studies have shown that people tend to spend time in small, densely-connected groups or in isolation, and that their connection behavior follows a circadian rhythm. To what extent both of these features influence the spread of diseases is as yet unclear. Therefore, a new temporal network model is devised here. Based on this model, circadially varying networks can for the first time be interpreted as following trajectories through a newly defined systemic state space. It is further revealed that in many temporally varying networks the system becomes less susceptible to infection when the time-scale of the disease approaches the time-scale of the network variation. This is in direct conflict with findings of other studies that predict increasing susceptibility of temporal networks, a discrepancy which is attributed to the invalidity of a widely applied approximation. The results presented here imply that new theoretical advances are necessary to study the spread of diseases in temporally varying networks.},

The content of the book is at the interface of graph theory, stochastic processes and dynamical systems. The authors set out to make a significant contribution to closing the gap between model development and the supporting mathematics. This is done by: Summarising and presenting the state-of-the-art in modeling epidemics on networks with results and readily usable models signposted throughout the book; Presenting different mathematical approaches to formulate exact and solvable models; Identifying the concrete links between approximate models and their rigorous mathematical representation; Presenting a model hierarchy and clearly highlighting the links between model assumptions and model complexity; Providing a reference source for advanced undergraduate students, as well as doctoral students, postdoctoral researchers and academic experts who are engaged in modeling stochastic processes on networks; Providing software that can solve the differential equation models or directly simulate epidemics in networks. Replete with numerous diagrams, examples, instructive exercises, and online access to simulation algorithms and readily usable code, this book will appeal to a wide spectrum of readers from different backgrounds and academic levels. Appropriate for students with or without a strong background in mathematics, this textbook can form the basis of an advanced undergraduate or graduate course in both mathematics and biology departments alike},
